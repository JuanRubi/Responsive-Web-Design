                    <h3>Finding simplicity in life</h3>
                    <p>
                       <strong>Life can get complicated really quickly</strong>, but it doesn't
                       have to be! There are many ways to simplify your life, <a href="#">a few
                       of which we've explored in the past</a>. This week we're taking a bit of
                       a different approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life
                       you are already living.

                    <h3>Decluttering</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is important to take time to declutter. This frees up space and time to
                        focus on what's really important.

                    <h3>Simplicity and Work</h3>
                    <p>
                        Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins
                        their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your
                        work life as simple as possible, it will help balance everything out.

                    <h3>Simple Decorations</h3>
                    <p>
                        A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't
                        decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were
                        hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you want it to and
                        make things pop like never before.
                    </p>
